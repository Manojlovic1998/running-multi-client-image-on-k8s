# :whale: Integration of Multi Container App using Kubernetes

This is Kubernetes example project of multi-container images running on local Kubernetes Cluster. A topic of the project is orchestrating a fib. number calculator with the use of Kubernetes.

The images used for this project are derived from a previous project that I have done. These images have been pushed to my docker hub profile.

_Previous Project Repo_: [Docker Fib Calculator](https://github.com/Manojlovic1998/docker-fib-calculator)  
_My Docker Hub Profile_: [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/manojlovic1998)

## :house: How to Run Project Locally

To run the project locally you will need to:

1. Clone the repository  
   `git clone https://github.com/Manojlovic1998/docker-fib-calculator.git`
2. Make sure you have Docker & Docker Compose installed on your system. If not you can use the following links [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to set it up.
3. After you have cloned the repo, go into projects' root directory.  
   `cd docker-fib-calculator`
4. You can run the project in development or production mode. To do so run one of the following commands.  
    **Development**  
    `sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`  
   **Production**  
   `sudo docker-compose up`
5. You can visit the client application by going to `http://localhost:8080/`

## :pencil: Applications Writeup

### **Client React App**

Client is a frontend Fibonacci index number value calculator application. It is built with the help of React technology. It's main purpose is to facilitate user input action where the data from the input is sent to the server (api). It also is fetching the data from the api on page load with the help of axios library.

**Low Fidelity Wireframe:**

- ![Diagram preview of app functionality and sections data origin](/assets/diagrams/client-low-fid.drawio.png)

**High Fidelity Wireframes:**

- Bootstrap: Extra large > 1200px
  ![Desktop preview of client application UI](/assets/wireframes/bootstrap-extra-large-1200px.png)

- Bootstrap: Extra small < 576px
  <br>
  ![Mobile preview of client application UI](/assets/wireframes/bootstrap-extra-small-576px.png)

**Features:**

- [x] Home page
- [x] Form for index input
- [x] Navigation bar with custom logo
- [x] Section containing seen indexes and calculated index values
- [x] Responsive design
- [x] Api calls to ExpressJS api app.

### **Formats of Data Received from API**

#### **Route `/api/values/all`**

**Seen Indices**  
Method: Get  
Data Type: Object  
Data Example:

```JavaScript
data: {
  0: "1"
  3: "3"
  4: "5"
  6: "13"
}
```

#### **Route `/api/values/current`**

**Seen Indexes**  
Method: Get  
Data Type: Array  
Data Example:

```JavaScript
data: [
  0: 3
  1: 4
  2: 6
  3: 0
]
```

### **Formats of Data Sent to API**

#### **Route `/api/values`**

Method: Post  
Data Type: JSON  
Data Example:

```JSON
  {"index": "3"}
```

### **Server/API ExpressJS App**

The Express server serves as api layer that communicates with Redis and Postgres and passes information to the React app from them.

**Express api diagram:**

- ![Diagram preview of express app functionality and services it fetches data from to server back to react app](/assets/diagrams/express-diagram.drawio.png)

**Express Routes Description:**

- `domain/` is a test route that was used to test connection to the app during early development.
- `domain/values/all` queries and sends back all of the data from Postgres db instance. GET
- `domain/values/current` queries and sends back all of the values from Redis instance. GET
- `domain/values` receives users submitted data, checks if index is within worker limit to prevent bottleneck, sets a placeholder data in Redis instance, and creates a channel over which it sends the index value that worker picks up to do the calculation. POST

**Features:**

- [x] Test route.
- [x] Route to query and send back data from Postgres.
- [x] Route to query and send back data from Redis.
- [x] Route to receive, validate and record user submitted data.

### **Worker app**

Worker instance listens to Redis **_instance_** channel. **\*Instance** channel is established by Express `domain/values` route. There the publisher sends index via channel message. Worker picks up the message (index) and uses the following algorithm to find the number at the given index in Fibonacci Sequence.

**Simple Algorithm**

```javascript
// Basic solution to fib number
// Takes index and returns its value
function fib(index) {
  if (index < 2) return 1;
  return fib(index - 1) + fib(index - 2);
}
```

### **Nginx**

Nginx is used to enforce routing. It routes the incoming request traffic to the appropriate application. The `/api/` prefix to request url is used as a way to distinguish between request for Express and the request for the React server.

**Nginx Default Config**

```
upstream client {
    server client:3000;
}

upstream api {
    server api:5000;
}

server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://client;
    }

    location /ws {
        proxy_pass http://client;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }

    location /api {
        rewrite /api/(.*) /$1 break;
        proxy_pass http://api;
    }
}
```
